Recording Mod
=============

This mod allows for the players in-game to see when somebody is recording/streaming using the players list (tab), the display is controlled using the /rec r/s command, where r is recording and s is streaming, the command toggles the status of the player using it.
There are two @'s in the players list, one is for recording and turns red when the players status is set to record while the other is for streamers and lights up in green when streaming.
